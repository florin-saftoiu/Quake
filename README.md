Hacking the Quake source code
==========================================
This is me trying to understand and mess around with the Quake source code.

The Visual Studio solution has been migrated to Visual Studio 2019 and changes were made to make it compile and run. See the first 10 commits on `master` to see all the changes.

Requirements
------------
* Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
* Make sure you install MFC
